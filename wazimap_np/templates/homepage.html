            <p>NepalMap makes data on Nepal more accessible and understandable to everyone.</p>
<p>NepalMap is of great use to journalists, students, academics and others who are interested in using data to learn about each district, and soon every Village Development Committee.</p>
<p>This tool is a friendly and reliable resource for journalists who want to use data to tell stories or discover stories that are of public interest.</p>
<p>NepalMap uses data from <a href="http://www.cbs.gov.np/" target="_blank">Central Bureau of Statistics</a>, to create user-friendly data visualizations on key demographic issues.</p>
<p>You can </span><strong>embed, access or download</strong> the data too. You can also compare any two areas side-by-side. </span></p>
<p>NepalMap is a project of <a href="http://codefornepal.org/en/"><strong>Code for Nepal</strong></a>, a non-profit that works to increase digital literacy and the use of open data in Nepal. We are an all-volunteer organization. Please make a </span><a href="https://www.paypal.me/CodeforNepal" target="_blank"><strong>tax deductible donation</strong></a> to help us maintain the server space for NepalMap, and empower Nepal digitally!</p>
<p>Code for Nepal's co-founder, <a href="http://codefornepal.org/en/staff/ravinepal/" target="_blank">Ravi Kumar</a>, is grateful to all the volunteers who contributed to Nepal Map! Code for Nepal is especially grateful to <a href="https://github.com/cliftonmcintosh" target="_blank">Clifton McIntosh</span></a>, for serving as the lead developer for this project.
